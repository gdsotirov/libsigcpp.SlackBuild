libsigc++: LibSigC++ (Callback Framework for C++)
libsigc++:
libsigc++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++.
libsigc++: It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to
libsigc++: any callback function, either global or a member function,
libsigc++: regardless of whether it is static or virtual. It also contains
libsigc++: adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an
libsigc++: ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.
